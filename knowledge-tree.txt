How to Use the Tree

Identify the Question Type: Is the question about a single proportion, a difference in proportions, a single mean, a difference in means, a relationship between categorical variables, or a relationship between quantitative variables (regression)? This will guide you to the correct branch of the tree.

Identify the Task: Is the question asking you to:

Calculate something (a test statistic, a confidence interval, expected counts)?

Interpret something (a p-value, a confidence interval, a standard deviation)?

Check conditions for inference?

Set up hypotheses?

Make a decision/conclusion based on a p-value or confidence interval?

Determine the correct procedure.

Follow the Branches: Navigate the tree based on your answers to steps 1 and 2. This will lead you to the relevant unit and quiz that covers the specific concepts needed to answer the question.

Example

Let's say you're given the following question:

"A researcher wants to know if the average height of adult women in Town A is different from the average height of adult women in Town B. She takes independent random samples from each town and measures the heights. What hypothesis test should she use?"

Question Type: This involves two samples and a quantitative variable (height), and we're comparing means. This points us toward Unit 7, and the section on differences of means.

Task: The question asks about the appropriate hypothesis test.

Follow the Branches: Unit 7 -> "Sampling distributions for the difference of means" -> "Setting up" (since it is about the test itself) . This tells us the relevant concepts are covered in the "Setting Up a Test for the Difference of Two Population Means" section.

This knowledge tree provides a structured way to connect any AP Statistics question on inference back to the fundamental concepts it tests. This is incredibly helpful for both studying and reviewing. It helps you see the big picture of how all these different inferential procedures relate to each other.
